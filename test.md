# Google Antigravity

Google Antigravity is an **AI-powered code generation and development platform (IDE)** launched by Google, built upon the **Gemini 3 Pro model**.  
It is considered a strong competitor to existing AI coding tools like **Cursor** and **Windsurf**.

## 1. Key Features and Components

### 🔹 AI Agent-Driven Development
- Users input their desired functionality in natural language, and the AI Agent interprets and develops the code.

### 🔹 Three Core Components
- **Editor**: Where the user provides natural language prompts for their web app ideas  
- **AI Agent**: Creates a task list and implementation plan based on the input, and writes the actual code  
- **Browser**: Executes the developed app immediately and uses browser automation for the AI Agent to perform direct testing and verification (**major strength**)

### 🔹 Development Process
1. **Planning**: The AI Agent generates a task list and an implementation plan  
2. **Development and Implementation**: The code is written according to the plan  
3. **Automated Testing**: The browser automation verifies the UI and functionality  

### 🔹 Agent Manager System
- Supports multi-agent and parallel development tasks  
- Enhances productivity with concepts like **Inbox**, **Workspace**, and **Playground**

### 🔹 Development Modes
- **Planning Mode**: Plans are created and reviewed before development begins (default)  
- **Fast Mode**: Direct development without an explicit planning phase  

### 🔹 Technology Base
- Fork of **VS Code**, sharing a similar UI with Cursor  
- Speculated to be the result of Google acquiring key Windsurf personnel  

### 🔹 Supported Models
- Gemini 3 Pro (High/Low)  
- Claude Sonnet 4.5  
- GPT OS models

## 2. Status and Review

### 🔹 Accessibility
- Currently offered for free as a **Public Preview**  
- Allows unrestricted use of models including Gemini 3 Pro High  

### 🔹 Strengths
- Optimized for the Gemini 3 Pro model → better performance and design output compared to Cursor  
- Powerful browser integration and testing features → highly optimized for frontend development  
- High productivity expected from multi-agent and parallel task support  

### 🔹 Drawbacks and Concerns
- As a new release, it exhibits stability issues (agent stoppage, usage limit errors) → needs optimization  
- Concerns about being a VS Code fork  
- Potential risk of Google discontinuing the service
